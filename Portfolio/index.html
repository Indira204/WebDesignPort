<article id="funfact">
 <p>Hi everyone! Thank you for stopping by, my name is Indira Lopez and I am a Web Designer. All of the projects that you're about to see are made by me, and were either made as part of a coding boot camp or as a personal project.
I come from a non traditional programming background, meaning everything I know I have taught myself or I learned it from free coding programs. I have tried my hand at various programming languages such as Python, SQL, Java, but ultimately I find the most joy in building websites. More specifically designing them with HTML & CSS. I hope you enjoy my projects as much as I have enjoyed making every single one of them! If you like any particular design or have a project in mind that you think I could be of help, feel free to contact me at anytime.</p>
