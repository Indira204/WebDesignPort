 <p> Hi there! I'm Indira Lopez, an IT Support Specialist with a passion for learning and helping others.
I created this portfolio as a way to expand on my skills and showcase my interests. This website and the featured projects are all made by me using HTML and CSS.
My career began at Google, where for 12 months I collaborated with IT Engineers to deliver global support to Google employees. Beyond my core responsibilities, 
I also contributed to impactful projects designed to benefit both users and support techs. 
Being in this role was truly a rewarding experience, knowing that I was able to help others while also learning new skills is something I look forward to every day!
